I am a tenure-track assistant professor at Faculty of Information and Human Sciences in Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan from Mar. 2019. Before joining Kyoto Institute of Technology, I was an assistant professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) from Apr. 2016 to Mar. 2019 and at Osaka School of International (OSIPP), Osaka University from Apr. 2015 to Mar. 2016.
	
I obtained PhD of Information Science and Technology at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Katsuro Inoue. My research interests are in the areas of software engineering, in particular reused code management/detection, refactoring support, and test code generation.
